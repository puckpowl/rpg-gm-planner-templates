# rpg-gm-planner-templates
A collection of open templates for RPG GM planners. Made for DnD 5e, but should be possible to use with other systems as well.

Intended to be printed on DIN A5 paper, two-sided with space on the margin to punch holes for a binder - other formats will need some adaptions on sizes etc.

Disclaimer: I am not a frontend developer so the HTML/CSS/JS is mostly pragmatic and trial-and-error... Improvement pull requests are welcome :)
